# G++ Language Lexer using Flex and Yacc

This project includes a lexer for the G++ language, meticulously crafted using Lex/Flex. It is engineered to scan G++ source code, efficiently tokenizing it in accordance with the language's syntactic rules. The lexer forms a foundational component of a broader compiler system, facilitating the subsequent parsing and compilation stages by breaking down the source code into a stream of meaningful tokens.

## Features

- **Robust Tokenization**: Accurately processes G++ language constructs including keywords, operators, identifiers, and literals, transforming raw text into tokens.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Implements strategies to detect and report unrecognized tokens, ensuring the robustness of the lexer.

## Requirements

- **Flex**: A tool for generating programs that perform pattern-matching on text.
